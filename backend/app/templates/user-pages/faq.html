                <h1>Unigames FAQ<br></h1>

                <h2>What is Unigames?</h2>
                <p>Unigames is UWA's gaming and roleplaying club. The club was formed in 1983, when two previous UWA
                    clubs - the Wargaming club and the Simulations Society - merged to form one club. Since then we have
                    only grown stronger, and although our focus often shifts rapidly from roleplaying to wargaming and
                    back again, we maintain a huge library so you can organise any and all of these activities whenever
                    you like!</p>

                <h2>What can I do at Unigames?</h2>
                <p>Play games! There are many <a href="roleplaying.php">roleplaying</a> campaigns in action at the
                    moment, held either weekly or fortnightly. Popular roleplaying systems at the moment include D&amp;D
                    (5th, 4th and Pathfinder are most common), Dark Heresy (and family), nWoD, and Ad Eva 3.5 (giant
                    robots!).</p>

                <p>For the non-roleplayers, if you pick the right moment it's usually possible to tap the boundless
                    energy of Unigames hordes for Dominion, Settlers of Catan, Munchkin, Dead of Winter, X-COM or any of
                    our other dozens of boardgames. But if you get addicted, you may want to consider the statutory
                    withdrawal dates for some or all of your units! It's a case of choosing your poison - the Unigames
                    library has a plethora of weird and wonderful games in stock, some of which are used all the time,
                    and some of which haven't been dusted off in a decade. Who knows what you could find.</p>

                <h2>Where is the Unigames clubroom?</h2>
                <p>(The following directions are cheerfully borrowed from <a
                        href="http://unisfa.gu.uwa.edu.au">UniSFA</a>.) For a start, Unigames is located above the UWA
                    (35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley) Tavern. If you don't know where that is, just ask anyone you can find,
                    wandering anywhere on campus. From standing in front of the Tavern, facing the Tavern, walk left and
                    follow the Tavern's fence around the corner. Keep wandering around this wall of the Tavern until you
                    hit an inset in the wall. The door facing away from the river is the entrance to all the higher
                    parts of Cameron Hall. If that doesn't help, <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BTEKh21mA&amp;feature=youtu.be">you can also follow this
                        handy video from our 2018 President Gavin</a>.</p>

                        alt="Cameron Hall Map Thumbnail"
                        style="float:left; border: solid 1px black; margin-right: 10px"></a>

                <p>Once you've found the entrance to Cameron Hall, follow the stairs up to the second floor (i.e. two
                    stories up), walk past whatever club currently inhabits the first room, take the big doors and go
                    straight ahead. Ignore the glass doors to your right, and keep walking. Unigames is the first
                    clubroom on the right.</p>

                <p>If you still fear getting lost inside the endless passages and and mirrored hallways of Cameron Hall,
                    there's a link to the left to a map of the second floor of the building, to put your mind at ease.
                    Thanks to Lisa Green and Mark Sander for letting us use their precious map.</p>

                <h2>When is Unigames open?</h2>
                <p>Whenever you can grab one of the gatekeepers by the arm and make them unlock the cabinet/clubroom ï¿½
                    which is more or less whenever you want it to be. We are blessed with gatekeepers who have made
                    Cameron Hall, the location of the Unigames clubroom, their surrogate home, and it's unlikely one of
                    them won't be around at virtually any time you're likely to be. Of course, if you do hang around
                    more than they do (and run campaigns) you can apply for gate - just ask a committee member or
                    gatekeeper for the form.</p>

                <h2>What discounts do I get?</h2>
                <p>One of the benefits of Unigames membership is a 10% discount on all materials at Tactics, Perth's
                    premier gaming supply store. Just show your membership card when you go to pay for things.</p>
