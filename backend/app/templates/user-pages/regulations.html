                                            <li>Each unit of paint has a number or code written on it. Whenever a unit of

                                    <li>At the end of that event, the list of resources on the whiteboard should be used to check that all resources 
                                        have been returned. The list should then be erased.

                                    <li>If the resource(s) has not been returned within two days after this contact, the borrower will receive another strike at each following

                        <ul>
                            <li>The responsible gatekeeper is neither obligated to award a consumable (for instance, in the case of the bin being emptied when it was already nearly empty,) nor 
                                barred from awarding themselves or other gatekeepers consumables â€“ though in such a case they still have to have actually emptied the bin.

                    <li>The key to the room may not be carried on persons for extended periods of time prior to 5PM. It should be extracted from the club cupboard only for the immediate

                        a gatekeeper to carry the keys to the clubroom on their person provided they remain within the upper floor of Cameron Hall. The keys

                            <li>The purchased resources will belong to Unigames.</li>
