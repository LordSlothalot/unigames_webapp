                                            <li>Each unit of paint has a number or code written on it. Whenever a unit of

                                    <li>At the end of that event, the list of resources on the whiteboard should be used to check that all resources 
                                        have been returned. The list should then be erased.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>The Librarian will attempt to contact the member in question, explaining the consequences of the "strike", along with the date 
                                        the resource(s) needs to be returned by.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If the resource(s) has not been returned within two days after this contact, the borrower will receive another strike at each following 
                                        Committee meeting until the resource(s) is returned.

                        <ul>
                            <li>The responsible gatekeeper is neither obligated to award a consumable (for instance, in the case of the bin being emptied when it was already nearly empty,) nor 
                                barred from awarding themselves or other gatekeepers consumables – though in such a case they still have to have actually emptied the bin.

                            <li>Members shall not be eligible to claim a free consumable if they have already received a reward for the same instance of that action

                    <li>The key to the room may not be carried on persons for extended periods of time prior to 5PM. It should be extracted from the club cupboard only for the immediate 
                        purpose of opening something, and returned immediately after this. After 5PM and until 8AM the following day it is permissible for 
                        a gatekeeper to carry the keys to the clubroom on their person provided they remain within the upper floor of Cameron Hall. The keys 
                        must be returned to the cupboard by the time that the last gatekeeper leaves Cameron Hall.

                                the finance tracking book.

                        <ul>
                            Unigames will cover half the cost of any game resources (such as 'splat' books or board games) when 
                            a member or group of members pledges the other half, subject to a committee vote.
                            <li>The purchased resources will belong to Unigames.</li>
                            <li>This regulation is intended to supply things such as non-core RPG texts for club members to use.</li>

                        book, then it shall be recorded as such inside the resource.

                    <br>

                    <li>Unigames will cover the cost of a one-day pass to SwanCon so that the Librarian or their delegate may 
                        research and trial resources for the club.
